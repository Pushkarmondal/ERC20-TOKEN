# ERC20-TOKEN

ERC-20 is a widely adopted standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Fungible tokens are digital assets that are interchangeable with each other, meaning one token is always equal in value to another token of the same type. Here's a description of the key features and functions of ERC-20 tokens:

1. **Name, Symbol, and Decimals**: ERC-20 tokens typically have three properties: a name (e.g., "MyToken"), a symbol (e.g., "MTK"), and a number of decimal places (usually 18). These properties help users identify and work with the token.

2. **Total Supply**: ERC-20 tokens have a fixed total supply, which represents the maximum number of tokens that can ever exist. This supply is usually set during token creation and is immutable.

3. **Balances**: Each Ethereum address (account) can hold a balance of ERC-20 tokens. The `balanceOf` function allows anyone to check the balance of tokens held by a specific address.

4. **Transfer**: ERC-20 tokens can be transferred from one address to another using the `transfer` function. It requires the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to send. This function ensures that the sender has a sufficient balance to make the transfer.

5. **Approval**: To enable controlled spending of tokens by third-party contracts or addresses, ERC-20 tokens use an "approval" mechanism. Token holders can approve specific addresses to spend a certain amount of their tokens using the `approve` function.

6. **Allowance**: The `allowance` function allows anyone to query the amount of tokens that a spender (address or contract) is approved to spend on behalf of another address. This function helps prevent overspending.

7. **TransferFrom**: To spend tokens on behalf of another address, the approved spender uses the `transferFrom` function. It requires the owner's address, the recipient's address, and the amount of tokens to transfer. The spender must have a sufficient allowance to perform this action.

8. **Events**: ERC-20 tokens emit events such as `Transfer` and `Approval` whenever transfers or approvals occur. These events provide transparency and allow external applications to react to token movements.

9. **Standard Interface**: ERC-20 tokens follow a standardized interface, which means they all have the same set of functions and events. This standardization ensures interoperability and allows wallets and exchanges to support a wide range of tokens without needing custom integration for each one.

10. **Security**: ERC-20 tokens often use the SafeMath library (as shown in your code) to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.

ERC-20 tokens are the foundation for many blockchain-based assets, including cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and security tokens. They have played a significant role in the development of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and tokenized assets on the Ethereum platform. Developers can create their own ERC-20 tokens by implementing the standard interface, as demonstrated in the code you provided earlier.
